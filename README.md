# ecommerce
a simple e commerce website that ive been working on . built using html,css and js.


the images i have provided will not get along with the code as the path in the code which refers to the image is different.

i will attach the web page images so you will figure it out where the things need to be.

you can create a file and the respective images as per the path in the code.

or the simple way to do it is to remove the path and just keep the image link which directly links the image which i have provided.

thank you enjoy the way ....
